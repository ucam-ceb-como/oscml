The test cases in this folder are developer regression tests. The results have been generated on author's personal machine, thus they are hardware dependent and will fail if you run them elsewhere. It is hoped that in the future it will be possible to abstract the hardware, e.g. via an automated docker container so that the tests will work for everyone. Note that the test results have been compared to the old version of the oscml code and match perfectly.

Note on transfer learning tests:
The transfer learning results depend on how the job is run. Namely, the results from a composed job, where the hpo, best trial retraining and transfer learning goals are executed one after another as a single job will be different compared to a two-jobs approach, where first the hpo and best trial retraining are run and then the second transfer learning job is executed. The same behaviour was observed in the old oscml code. It is believed that the results discrepancy arises in the pytorch lighning trainer where some of the random training params are initialised differently in the composed and non-composed job approaches. The current code was tested against the old oscml code and the results agree 100%.
