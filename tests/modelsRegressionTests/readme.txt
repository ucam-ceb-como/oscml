The test cases in this folder are developer regression tests. The results have been generated on author's personal machine, thus they are hardware dependent and will fail if you run them elsewhere. It is hoped that in the future it will be possible to abstract the hardware, e.g. via an automated docker container so that the tests will work for everyone. Note that the test results have been compared to the old version of the oscml code and match perfectly.
